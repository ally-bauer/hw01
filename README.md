My name is Alethea Bauer, but everybody has always called me **Ally**.  I got my undergraduate degree, a BA in Psychology, from Michigan State University.  My favorite animals are as follows:

* Cows
* Dogs
* Elephants
* Ducks
* Turtles

I - my family back home, anyway - have two dogs and a duck.  We are in the process of getting a second duck to replace one that met an unfortunate end.
